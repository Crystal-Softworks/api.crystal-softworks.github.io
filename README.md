# My Express Template

This is the template I use when I want to build something with Express.js. It leverages event emitters for a nice architecture.

## Installation

Want to use my template?

1. **Clone this repository**
   Well, how do I do that?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0neShot101/express-template.git
```

2. **Enter the directory**
```bash
cd express-template
```

Now that I've walked you through, you can enjoy!
